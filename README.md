# Train A Smartcab to Drive

This is a Udacity project's submission where we use Q-Learning to teach a smartcab to drive around city streets with their traffic.

To run, cd to `smartcab` directory and run command `python smartcab/agent.py`. It requires pygame module which must be installed as binary in Windows (instead of using pip install).
